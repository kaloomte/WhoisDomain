Ideas for the future, worth looking in to:

I think than in the long-term approach, an approched based on JSWhois approach is the most interesting: https://github.com/jschauma/jswhois/blob/main/src/jswhois.go / https://www.netmeister.org/blog/whois.html i.e:

1 define a common nomenclature, flat AND tree based (for multiple entities) loosely inspired from RDAP but much simpler
2 categorize TLD by their NIC Whois format type
3 do some custom parsing capabilities for some TLDs that have a derived version of format
4 add RDAP support to this library for some TLD like .be who dropped Whois
5 add unit tests for every TLD - at least 3 different would be better
6: (Nice to have: 6. detect "privacy" comments)

mboot: interesting the JSWhois can be used for parsing hints just like rfc1036 can be used for whois server hints
they should be make independent on their own repo so hey can be use dby others also
