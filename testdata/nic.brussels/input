% The WHOIS service offered by DNS Belgium and the
% access to the records in the DNS Belgium WHOIS
% database are provided for information purposes only.
% It allows persons to check whether a specific domain
% name is still available or not and to obtain
% information related to the registration records of
% existing domain names. DNS Belgium cannot, under any
% circumstances, be held liable in case the stored
% information would prove to be wrong, incomplete or
% not accurate in any sense.
% By submitting a query you agree not to use the
% information made available to:
% * allow, enable or otherwise support the transmission
%   of unsolicited, commercial advertising or other
%   solicitations whether via email or otherwise;
% * target advertising in any possible way;
% * to cause nuisance in any possible way to the
%   registrants by sending (whether by automated,
%   electronic processes capable of enabling high
%   volumes or other possible means) messages to them.

% Without prejudice to the above, it is explicitly
% forbidden to extract, copy and/or use or reutilise in
